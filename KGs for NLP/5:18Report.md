* In the last week after reading some papers and Surveys about the Knowledge Graph, like Knowledge Graph Embedding, Knowledge Graph Completion, etc.  
  * Knowledge Graph Embedding: learn low-dimensional distributed embedding of entities and relations. And there are some detailed directions for researching, I will try to look for them and then post detailed research here.
    * A Survey on Knowledge Graphs: Representation, Acquisition, and Applications (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9416312)
    * A Survey on Knowledge Graph Embedding: Approaches, Applications, and Benchmarks (https://www.mdpi.com/706496)
  * KGE may have some interaction with word embedding and sentence embedding:
    * KGs and word embedding: http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-2019/project/26418192.pdf
    * KGs and sentence embedding: https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.11226
  * Understanding the basic KGE approaches can help me to know how to adjust graph structure,  and a good KGE can help to do some other NLP tasks which need to use graph structures and KGs as resources.
* Read lab's paper (mainly about word embedding, network, and graph embedding), and I think there will have some useful things that can help me. (maybe it is hard for me now to totally understand these papers, but I think that is necessary)
  * Graph Embedding:
    * Graph Embedding with Shifted Inner Product Similarity and Its Improved Approximation Capability (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03463)
    * On representation power of neural network-based graph embedding and beyond(https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.12332)
    * Robust Graph Embedding with Noisy Link Weights (https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.08440)
  * Network: 
    * A Hypergraph Approach for Estimating Growth Mechanisms of Complex Networks (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9682667?arnumber=9682667)
  * Word Embedding
* In the future, I will post my detailed direction and idea here.
